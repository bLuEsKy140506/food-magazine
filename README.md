# HA-FoodMagazine-GITFLOW

You and your friend want to share recipes with your audience. To do that,
you decide to develop a food magazine app with two types of pages: a main
page with a list of recipes and a recipe page.
Go through the development process and take screenshots for each of the
following versions:

> Version 1.1: Design the website

> Version 1.2: Implement functions to add, edit, and delete recipes

> Version 1.3: Implement filter and search functions
